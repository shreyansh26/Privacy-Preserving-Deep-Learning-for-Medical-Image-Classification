With the rising use of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in various industries, the Medical industry is also not far behind. A very simple yet extremely important use case of Machine Learning in this industry is for image classification. Detecting certain diseases timely i.e in the earlier stages, is something which doctors can miss and in many cases actually do. In such cases, Deep Learning can assist doctors in determining if the patiient actually has the disease. However when using automated system like these, there is a privacy concern as well. For example if we consider that a group of hospitals use a centralised ML model, attackers have the capability to infer whether or not an individual is a patient at the hospital and is suffering from that disease or not, basically violating their right to privacy. Other than that, we also want the model to be secure, and the data that is sent to the model and the predictions that are recieved both should not be revealed to the model in clear text.

In this study, we aim to solve these problems in the context of a medical image classification problem, the problem we have considered is detection of pneumonia by examining chest x-ray images. We first train the model on a public dataset, secure and serve the machine learning model as a server and query the secured model to receive private predictions. We have trained three different models and all of them have a very high accuracy, the best one having around 95% accuracy.
