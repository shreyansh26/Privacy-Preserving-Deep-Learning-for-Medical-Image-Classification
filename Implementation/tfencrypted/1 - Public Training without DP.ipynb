    "\n",
    "By private predictions, we mean that the data is constantly encrypted throughout the entire process. At no point is the user sharing raw data, only encrypted (that is, secret shared) data. In order to provide these private predictions, [TF Encrypted](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted) combines cutting-edge cryptographic and machine learning techniques. But you don't have to worry about this and can focus on your machine learning application.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start serving private predictions with only three steps:\n",
    "* **Step 1**: train your model with normal Keras.\n",
    "* **Step 2**: secure and serve your machine learning model (server).\n",
    "* **Step 3**: query the secured model to receive private predictions (client).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let's go through these three steps so you can deploy impactful machine learning services without sacrificing user privacy or model security."
