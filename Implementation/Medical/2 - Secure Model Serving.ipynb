    "To secure and serve this model, we will need three TFE servers. This is because TF Encrypted under the hood uses an encryption technique called multi-party computation (MPC). The idea is to split the model weights and input data into shares, then send a share of each value to the different servers. The key property is that if you look at the share on one server, it reveals nothing about the original value (input data or model weights).\n",
