# Privacy-preserving Deep Learning for Medical Image Classification

Privacy Preserving Deep Learning for Medical Image Classification to detect chest pneumonia in chest X-ray images.

Uses [TF-Encrypted](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted) to implement Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) and Differential Privacy. SMPC helps to provide secure predictions and Differential Privacy is used to enhance privacy.

The implementation of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/shreyansh26/Privacy-Preserving-Deep-Learning-for-Medical-Image-Classification/tree/master/Implementation/Medical).

The base model is a VGG16 model which is made secure and privacy-preserving.
